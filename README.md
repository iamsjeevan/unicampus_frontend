## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js (v18.x or later) and a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` installed.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Start the Backend First:** This frontend requires the `unicampus-backend` to be running. Please follow the setup instructions in its [README](https://github.com/iamsjeevan/unicampus-backend).

2.  **Clone the Frontend Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/iamsjeevan/unicampus_frontend.git
    cd unicampus_frontend
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. This is crucial for telling the frontend where to find the backend API.
    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *(Adjust the URL if your backend runs on a different port.)*

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
